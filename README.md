Scheduled Ingestion
Cron Job: Runs every hour (configurable via INGESTION_INTERVAL)

API Integration: Fetches products from WooCommerce REST API

Endpoint: GET /wp-json/wc/v3/products

Authentication: Basic auth via query parameters

Data Transformation
Products are transformed and stored with the following mapping:


on_sale	on_sale	Boolean mapping
created_at	date_created	ISO string preservation
Error Handling
Retry mechanism for failed API calls

Duplicate product prevention

Partial updates for existing products

## Sample Segmentation Input
Supported Operators
= : Equality

!= : Not equal

> : Greater than

< : Less than

>= : Greater than or equal

<= : Less than or equal

Example Rules
text
price > 1000
category = Electronics
stock_status = instock
on_sale = true
tags includes premium
price <= 5000
category != Accessories
stock_quantity > 10
Complex Examples
text
# High-priced electronics in stock
price > 5000
category = Electronics
stock_status = instock

# Affordable products on sale
price < 1000
